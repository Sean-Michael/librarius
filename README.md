# Librarius 

> "A Librarium or Librarius is the command and communications centre of a Space Marine Chapter's fortress-monastery, and the repository for centuries of wisdom and history, culled from the reports, treatises and memoirs of the chapter's greatest warriors and finest minds." - [Lexicanum](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Librarium) 

Just as Codex Astartes chapters rely on their Librarian order to maintian records, we will use RAG to give LLMs an understanding of the rules for Warhammer 40k!
